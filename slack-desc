# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

mg-openbsd: 
mg-openbsd: Compatibility with GNU Emacs is key for Mg, separating it from
mg-openbsd: other ErsatzEmacs clones, because there should never be any
mg-openbsd: reason to learn more than one Emacs flavor.
